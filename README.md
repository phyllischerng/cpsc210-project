# Bubble Tea Tracker

## An app for boba addicts

My personal project idea is a desktop Java application that is able to track the bubble tea intake of the user. 
It does so by allowing the user to input the drink(s) that they ingested throughout the day, week, or month, etc... 
And the program will calculate the amount of calories they have ingested in total as well as the amount of money
they have spent on purchasing bubble tea drinks. 

The key features include:
- User can select the type of drink (milk or non-milk)
- User can choose the sugar level (0%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 100%, 120%)
- User can select a topping they ingested
- The total amount of money the user has spent so far on bubble tea
- The total amount of calories the user has ingested

Possible extra features include:
- A *surprise me* button in which the application generates a random drink for the user to try out
- A personalized recommendation on which drink to try next based on the user's past drinks

This project is of interest to me because I grew up drinking bubble tea. When bubble tea's popularity started to grow
in Vancouver, I was extremely happy because it meant more accessibility to these drinks. However, as it is easier to
buy bubble tea now, it is very common to overspend on it, which can also cause health concerns. For someone like me who
is not only health-conscious, but also money-conscious, an application like this will help me be more aware of how much 
I actually drink bubble tea.

##Instructions for Grader
- You can generate the first required event by: Press add drink, choose a size, choose a flavour, choose a sugar level,
choose a topping, input number of calories (integer) and press submit, enter a price (double) such as 5.12 and press
submit. This will add the Drink to the list on the right side when the application is reopened.
- You can generate the second required event by closing the application and reopening it, as the second event's goal
is to display that the new drink's calories and price is added to the total on the left panel.
- You can save the state of my application by entering a drink. The application will save automatically.
- You can reload the state of my application by closing my application and reopening it as the state will load
automatically.
